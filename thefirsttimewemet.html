    <div class="message-container">
        <p>
        I met you online, and back then, you didn’t even know how much I admired you already. At first, it was just a simple crush. I found you so intimidating in a good way. You had this strong presence. The way you think, the way you talk, your mindset — it stood out to me. You weren’t just pretty. You were smart. Mature. Different.
        <br><br>
        For six months, I kept that crush not quietly, kasi alam kong papansin ako sa'yo but at the same time I didn't confess directly and clear my intentions. I didn’t know if you would ever see me the way I see you. Then one day I actually came back in rp, then I felt differently, you made me fall in love with you.
        <br><br>
        And somehow, everything changed.
        <br><br>
        On September 29, 2025, you became mine — and I became yours. I’ll never forget that date. Not because it’s just our anniversary, but because it’s the day my silent crush turned into something real.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes I still can’t believe it. The girl I used to admire from afar is now the one I call my girlfriend. The one I talk to not every day. The one I have a crush on is now the one I want to build a future with.
        <br><br>
        You don't know how much I thank God for giving you to me.
        <br><br>
        From being intimidated by you…<br>
        To admiring you…<br>
        To crushing on you for six months…<br>
        To loving you now.
        <br><br>
        I’m so glad I didn’t give up on my feelings. And I’m even more grateful that you chose me.
        <br><br>
        September 29, 2025 will always be special to me — because that’s the day my biggest crush became my greatest blessing. 💗
