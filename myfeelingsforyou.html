        <p>
        I know I'm not showy enough, but I still love you, Honey. And honestly, I think that feeling keeps growing every single day. Sometimes I don’t know how to explain what I truly feel. It’s like my heart understands it, but my words can’t fully describe it. But even if I can’t perfectly say everything, I still want to try — because you deserve to hear it. I just want you to know how much I appreciate you. I appreciate your presence, your time, your effort, and even the little things you do that you think go unnoticed. I see them. I feel them. And they mean so much to me.
        <br><br>
        I want to assure you that I’m here for you. I’m not going anywhere. I choose you, and I will keep choosing you every single day. You don’t have to be perfect with me. You don’t have to hide your bad days, your worries, or your fears. I’m here not only for your happy moments, but also for the times when you feel tired and overwhelmed.
        <br><br>
        Please don’t ever think that you’re not enough, because you are more than enough for me. You make my life happy just by being in it. You make me feel loved, understood, and safe. And I hope, in my own ways, I make you feel the same.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for loving me, for trusting me, and for staying with me. I appreciate you more than I can fully explain. I’m really lucky to have you, and I will always treasure you and what we have together. 💗
