    <h1>🌷 The Plan For Us 🌷</h1>

    <div class="message-container">
        <p>
        One of my biggest plans is to save money — not just for myself, but for us. I want to be responsible. I want to ipon little by little so one day we can buy things that will make our life more comfortable and convenient. Maybe small things at first — things for our space, things that make daily life easier. I don’t need everything to be expensive. I just want everything to feel warm and ours.
        <br><br>
        I imagine us having our own place someday. It doesn’t have to be big. Just somewhere quiet and safe. Somewhere we can rest after a long day. Somewhere we can cook together, laugh over small things, maybe argue about what movie to watch, and then end the night peacefully.
        <br><br>
        I want to grow with you. Not just in love, but in life. I want us to improve ourselves, reach our goals, finish our studies, build our careers, and support each other’s dreams. I don’t want us to rush things. I want us to build slowly but surely — step by step, with patience and understanding.
        <br><br>
        I want to save for our future travels too. Even simple trips. Beach days. Late-night food trips. Or even just grocery shopping together and pretending we’re already living our married life.
        <br><br>
        I want to be financially stable so that when problems come, we won’t panic. I want us to feel secure. I want you to feel safe with me — emotionally and someday financially too.
        <br><br>
        Most of all, my plan is to choose you every day. To communicate better. To handle problems maturely. To grow, not apart, but together. I don’t want a perfect relationship. I want a strong one.
        <br><br>
        But for now, let's focus on what we have right now. I don't want to rush things that's why I say this but to give you an idea of what my intention is.
        <br><br>
        Our future doesn’t need to be flashy. It just needs to be real, stable, and full of love.
        <br><br>
        And I’m willing to work hard for that — for us. 💗
